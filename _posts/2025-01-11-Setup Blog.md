To create a blog with this theme, it was extremly simple thanks to the repo provided by @cotes2020, and can be completed by following the steps below:

1. Go to his repo [chirpy-starter (https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)
2. Click "Use Template"
3. For the Repository Name, use your GitHub Username, followed by github.io, example <YourGitHubUsername>.github.io.
4. Install Visual Studio Code and Docker Desktop on your local machine. 
5. Open Visual Studio Code, install the [Dev Containers]() Extension.
6. Please F1 and search for _Dev Containers: Clone Repository into Container Volume_.
7. Locate the Github repo you created in Step 1.
8. Let the Docker container spin up. 
9. With the container setup, follow the [Chirpy Configuration Steps](), this will allow the site to be available at <YourGitHubUsername>.github.io.
